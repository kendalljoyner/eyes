# Eye Movement Activity
## Project Title: 
Eye Exercise

## Description of Project: 
This assignment in the web development section of the MIT xPro Professional Coding Certificate program taught us to bring together JavaScript, CSS, and HTML in a fun, real world application. Though the functionality of this program is limited, it taught us to incorporate many of the fundamental programming techniques we have learned over the last 10 weeks. The program is designed to have the eyes follow your mouse (or finger tap on mobile.) 

## How to Run:
Within the desktop browser, the program will start automatically once the page is loaded. As you move your mouse, the eyes will follow. Doesnâ€™t matter how fast you go, the eyes will follow. Try to outrun them, I dare you!

On a mobile browser, the eyes will follow each tap. As you tap around the screen, the eyes will follow.

## Roadmap of Future Improvements: 
In the future, I plan to add an on-click function that adds new sets of eyes during each click. Subsequently, I would like to make some of the eyes bounce across the screen while continuing to follow the mouse.
